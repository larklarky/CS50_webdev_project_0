Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I have made a cooking site. 

# index.html

There is the main page, where a user can find top articles about cooking, and recipes, also it contains one main theme at the top of the page. 

# recipes.html

The Recipes page leads to the main theme from the main page which is a compilation of recipes popular for now. The user can go to one of the recipe pages and read the actual recipe.

# recipe.html (recipe_1.html, recipe_2.html)

There the user can find information about how long it takes to make the dish or the beverage, list of ingredients, and detailed directions. Also, it contains a photo of the dish.

# articles.html

 On the Articles page, the user will find all the articles available on the site. And it leads the user to the actual article page. 

# article_1.html, article.html

 On the Article page, the user can read the article. There are images, text, and quotes. 
 
# other information

 The navbar leads to Home, Recipes, and Articles pages from any page. The footer is not active and doesn't contain any links. Not all the recipes or articles are clickable.
